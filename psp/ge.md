Payment services in Georgia
===========================

Institutional arrangements
--------------------------

Payment services can be offered by credit insitutions (banks), payment
service providers (PSP) and microfinance organisations.

Payment service providers are regulated by the law on "Payment System
and Payment Service". A PSP is required to register with the
regulator, the National Bank of Georgia (NBG). [Order #90/04 of the
NBG](https://www.nbg.gov.ge/uploads/legalacts/paymentsysmens/2015/rules_of_registration_of_payment_service_provider_eng.doc)
governs the registrations and cancellation of PSPs.

A PSP can operate payment accounts for remittance and also e-money wallets.


Operating payment services
--------------------------

A separate category of low-value payment instruments is
established. Limits are in place for the low-value instruments:
individual payment transactions 140 GEL domestic, 70 GEL cross-border;
daily limits per instrument 1500 GEL domestic, 350 GEL cross-border;
and maximum e-money balance of 1500 GEL.

Reporting to the NBG is on a monthly basis. Number of payments and
volume is reported as well as fees charged. Outstanding customer funds
float is also reported, and liquid assets at a bank covering the
float. For e-money, the number of issued and monthly active wallets
and their balances is reported.


Commentary
----------

It appears that the Georgian payment services regulatory regime draws
inspiration from the EU Payment Services Directive (PSD). Registration
of PSPs is similar and the law shares properties such as separate
category of low-value payment instruments.
